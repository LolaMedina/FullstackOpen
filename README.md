This course is held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2020.

The course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. Its primary focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. 

GraphQL,TypeScript, testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data are also covered in the course. This repository contains my solutions for the course exercises.
